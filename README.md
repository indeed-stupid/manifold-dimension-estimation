# manifold-dimension-estimation

This repository contains the Python code used in the following research articles:

- **Manifold Dimension Estimation: Theory and Practice**
- **Beyond PCA: Two Curvature-Aware Manifold Dimension Estimators through Quadratic Embedding**

The code implements various algorithms and tools for estimating the intrinsic dimension of data lying on a manifold, including curvature-aware methods.
